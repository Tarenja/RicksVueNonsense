# Rick's Biographical Nonsense in Vue

Using the Rick & Morty API (rickandmortyapi.com) display the profiles of the characters (either
with pagination or showing the first page only).

The profile of a character should include:

* Image
* Character information (name, species, etc).
* Origin and location information (name, dimension, amount of residents, etc).
* Name of the chapters the character is featured on.

The API provides REST and GraphQL versions, for this exercise you should use the REST
version.

You are free to use any library/framework or even language. Be ready to explain the rationale
for your choices.

The exercise can be submitted in and online environment (we prefer codesandbox.io), a public
repository or a zip file. If you choose any of the last two options make sure that running your
solution requires no global dependencies (besides node/npm/yarn) and it's possible to run it with
only one command (besides yarn/npm install).

Write the code with production standards in mind.
